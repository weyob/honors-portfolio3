    <h1>Welcome to my sophomore year</h1><br>
    <p>
        Quarantine made it difficult to maintain my social life. As a result, my sophomore year was full of professional development. I accomplished a lot this year and got to celebrate my wins toward the end of Spring Quarter. Once I got my COVID-19 vaccine, I traveled to multiple states and finally reconnected with my friends and family in person after being seperated for so long due to the pandemic. Since the COVID-19 vaccine got released this year, hope was starting to spread that life would start returning back to normal.

        In May 2021, I took a trip to Denver, CO with my dad for my cousin's high school graduation. It was a great escape from Seattle, and helped me reconnect with my family in Colorado. I also got to see what my life could have turned out to be - I was born in Colorado, so visiting places like the hospital I was born in and the apartments I used to live in was an interesting experience of envisioning "what could have been" if I had continued to grow up there.

        When school ended, I took a trip to Los Angeles, CA with a few friends. This was the most fun I had in such a long time. It felt like my first taste of freedom since the pandemic began. I got to reconnect with friends I hadn't seen in months, and got to finally see friends in person that I had only seen virtually for the last year and a half. My friends and I also experienced a positive culture shock with the sunny weather and friendly people in California, and came back to Seattle refreshed and ready to keep travelling.

    <p><strong>Calderwood Seminar for Public Writing: Math That Lies: Communicating Why Some Quantitative Arguments are Misleading or Bogus (H 221)</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        This was my first writing class at UW and it was incredible! I was super intimidated by this class because each week we had an in-depth critique of everyone's writing in front of the entire class. I was worried my writing wouldn't be good enough, but in just 10 weeks I learned the importance of and the skills to simplify complicated quantitative topics to be easily understood through writing. This was definitely one of my favorite classes I've ever taken! I also ended with a pretty good grade ;)

    <p><strong>Black Campus Ministries Co-President</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        After being a member my freshman year, I stepped up to the plate to run BCM my sophomore year. It was a struggle since most of our members had either graduated or stopped attending (as was a trend in most spaces during the pandemic). However, I had a great time growing closer with my advisors, Brandi and Wyietah, along with new and returning members of BCM! As president of BCM, I led weekly Bible Studies with a justice-centered approach and facilitied activities to build connection among attendees through a virtual setting.

    <p><strong>Changemakers in Computing Mentor</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During Winter Break 2020, I got hired as a mentor for the UW Allen School of Computer Science's Changemakers in Computing program. As a mentor, I created an outreach strategy calender to reach 9 youth development programs and recruit 25 mentees for our pilot year. Once the program began, I helped historically marginalized students code for social good during the 4-week summer program. I helped students debug their code during office hours and created virtual presentations and lesson plans to direct them in a week-long hackathon where they combined their technical skills with justice frameworks to use technology to positively impact an existing social issue.

    <p><strong>CodePath.org Mobile Development Student</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During Winter 2021, I enrolled in this 8-week course and learned how to code for iOS. I met for a couple hours each Saturday for coding lessons and Q&A sessions with industry leaders like Pinterest and SpaceX. Throughout the week I worked on my own time to complete each deliverable. By the end of the program, I had created an iOS app where users could upload and save flashcards to their device. With a simple tap, users can alternate between their inputted questions and answers.
