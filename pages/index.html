        <h1>Welcome</h1><br>
        <p>
            Welcome to my Honors portfolio. My name is Wintana Eyob and I'm a third year at the UW studying Informatics with Interdisciplinary Honors. This isn't your typical portfolio with a resume and projects, although if you're interested in that, you can find my professional experiences clearly laid out in <a href="">my other portfolio</a>. My Honors portfolio is a site I created as part of my final requirements for graduating with Interdisciplinary Honors at the University of Washington (UW).
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            This site is a culmination of my undergraduate experience at UW. You'll get to see how I've evolved academically, professionally, and personally in my four years here.

        <h2>Learning statement</h2><br>
        <p>
            When I was 16, I put ‚Äúlearn how to code‚Äù on my bucket list.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            I heard it was the future of our world (whatever that meant), so I thought it would be a useful skill to pick up. But, I never made an action plan for how I'd learn how to code. In fact, I forgot about that bucket list for a few years.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            It wasn't until a few years later that I'd seriously consider learning how to code.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            I came into UW uncertain about my career and what I wanted to study. When filling out the application, American Ethnic Studies (AES) was the only major that sounded appealing, so I applied for it (we have to apply to our majors at UW ü•≤) and got accepted into UW as an AES major ü•≥!
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            However, during the summer before my freshman year I realized that I didn't want to pursue AES. Even though I wasn't certain about what I wanted to study, I knew two things: I was passionate about social justice and I wanted to make a lot of money. I thought the road to this might be double majoring in sociology and marketing.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            I shared my plan with my advisor during Advising & Orientation. She told me I could pursue a double major in sociology and marketing if I wanted to, but I'd probably end up back in her office in a few years venting about how miserable I was. Yeah. I was surprised she said that too. After invalidating my goals, she also tried to convince me to major in dance because I told her I danced throughout high school.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            She partially redeemed herself at the end of our session by introducing me to Informatics and putting me in an introductory first-year interest group for the major. She explained that in this major I could fuel my passion for justice while learning technical skills, and registered me for Gender & Information Technology (INFO 102) and Introduction to Women's Studies (GWSS 200) along with a seminar with around 12 other freshmen registered for the same courses.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            I was just happy to be registered for classes that aligned with my interest in making money and passion for pursuing justice. And so began my journey at UW.
        </p><br>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            *PS I know how problematic my comments about major and salary may sound, but here was my reasoning: throughout high school, I had been involved in and led various activities, events and programs that pursued social justice; I knew I could make contributions toward justice with or without a degree. Therefore, I wanted to spend my time at UW learning a skill that I wouldn't invest in learning on my own time. Since coding was on my bucket list and was a guaranteed (key-word: guaranteed) money-maker, I decided on learning that new skill. I decided to pursue it through Informatics because I could have the best of both worlds in learning technical skills while applying those skills toward social justice. I understand that you can make a lot of money with social science majors, but I wanted my major to be a <em>guaranteed</em> money-maker (without needing to go to grad school). As much as I valued social justice, I also really valued financial security.
