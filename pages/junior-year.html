    <h1>Welcome to my junior year</h1><br>
    <p>
        During Autumn 2021 and Winter 2022 I mostly focused on my professional and academic life by balancing multiple jobs, classes, and leadership positions. However, after returning back from Spring Break 2022, I decided to devote more time to my social life and building relationships with the people I care about.

        This was my first year back in person since freshman year! I was super excited to go back in person, and grateful that I had the first half of Winter 2022 remote because it helped me stay focused on my schoolwork.

    <h1>Personal life</h1><br>
    <p>
        For Spring Break 2022 my friends and I took a girls trip to Puerto Rico. This was the most impactful trip I've taken to date, and my first trip I've taken out of the country without my parents. We enjoyed incredibly sunny weather, took enthralling adventures, and met incredible people. I came back to the States with a new zest for life, and desire for adventure.

    <p><strong>Strategic Business Communication (B CMU 301)</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During Winter 2022 I took one of the most valuable classes in my entire academic career. In B CMU 301 I improved my communication skills, and refined my ability to write emails, negotiate, write a report, visualize data, give an elevator pitch, create presentations, and give business recommendations. In just one quarter, I learned skills that will continue to help me in various areas of my life for years to come.

    <p><strong>Client-Side Development (INFO 340)</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During Spring 2022 I got the opportunity to code a website with three other classmates. This was a huge learning moment, as I got to work with multiple different tools and technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Firebase, GitHub). My teammates and I focused on increasing literacy among youth and young adults by creating a trendy platform that uses a reading tracker, book clubs, and aesthetic moodboards to encourage young people to read.

    <p><strong>Interdisciplinary Honors Peer Educator (Experiential Learning #1)</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Although I was selected to be a peer educator and prepared to do so last year, this was my first year actually teaching my students. During Autumn 2021 I utilized the lesson plans and activities I prepared last year to teach 12 newly admitted first year Honors students Honors requirements, how to make the most of their Husky experience, and help them build community among each other.

    <p><strong>Academic Success Coach</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Autumn 2021 was my first quarter as an Academic Success Coach. I was confident in my skills because of my past mentorship experience, but was nervous because I never formally coached students my own age and helped them do better in school. Although I was intimidated by my role, I gained more confidence the longer I remained a coach. I helped 6-9 students a week build skills in time management, study strategies, and more to reach their academic goals while maintaining academic wellness. I also spent a lot of time creating resources and presentations for students to build skills in time management, study strategies, and more. During Spring 2022 I switched roles and took more of a lead as an EOP Academic Success Coach where I connected with multiple campus partners to increase Academic Success Coach's exposure to historically marginalized students on campus.

    <p><strong>Husky 100 Recipient</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I was on a beach in Puerto Rico during Spring Break 2022 when I found out I had been awarded as Husky 100! Each year, the Husky 100 recognizes 100 undergraduate and graduate students from all UW campuses who are making the most of their time at the UW by making a difference on campus, in their communities and for the future. Receiving this recognition increased my confidence and served as a timely reminder that I'm moving in a positive direction and doing something right.

    <p><strong>iSchool Dean's Club Dinner Emcee</strong>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During Spring 2022 I got selected to emcee and speak at the annual iSchool Dean's Club Dinner. At the dinner we celebrated the iSchool's long-time donors, notable alumni, outstanding contributors, and NINE Husky 100 recipients. We also had the pleasure of hearing our Dean, Anind Dey, walk us through his plans for the future of the iSchool. I also had the opportunity to share about my journey to the iSchool, my successes, and how I'm giving back to the community. It was great meeting so many supporters of the iSchool, and served as another reminder that I'm doing something right.
